        <div><img src="images/clgtsm.jpeg" alt="mainImg" class ="center" width="600" height="400"/></div>
        <p>Speaking of favorite LoL rivalries in the LCS, nothing beats the classic Counterlogic Gaming vs Team SoloMid rivalry that has risen to popularity in the middle stages of the NA LCS. During the early stages of the league, TSM had no other rival than Cloud9. However, the rise of CLG threatened TSM‚Äôs reign but the players didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge CLG as a good team which is how the rivalry between these two legendary organizations came to be in the splits to come.</p>


        <h2>Perkz vs Rekkles</h2>
        <div><img src="images/perkzrekkles.jpeg" alt="mainImg" class ="center" width="600" height="400"/></div>
        <p>There has always been a debate on who the King of Europe is and the names that come on the top of the list are Perkz and Rekkles. Even though Caps has claimed the title today, the historical battle between these two has sparked so many debates in forums and comment sections on social media. The two belong on separate roles but the fact that they are the face of their respective organizations and are the two best players in the league have always placed them in constant comparisons.        </p>


        <h2>North America vs Europe</h2>
        <div><img src="images/naeu.jpeg" alt="mainImg" class ="center" width="600" height="400"/></div>
        <p>Undoubtedly the BIGGEST esports rivalry in the history of League of Legends is the rivalry between NA and EU. These two regions have always had it for each other with casters, players, coaches, fans, and even analysts joining in on the fun. This rivalry is so big that there are people who live and die on their belief that their region (NA/EU) is better than the other. Despite EU being more successful in terms of international performance in both MSI and Worlds, they still consider each other rivals.        </p>

In League of Legends, SKT are undoubtedly the more successful organization with multiple World Championships and LCK Championships.</p>
